## MSKey

[MSKey](https://ronhuidrom.github.io/mskey) (Meetei Script Keyboard) is a virtual keyboard for the [Meetei Script](https://ronhuidrom.github.io/meetei-script) (or Meetei Mayek).

MSKey is here: [huidr.github.io/mskey](https://ronhuidrom.github.io/mskey).

### Type Meetei Script on the go, any device, everywhere. No external app nor installation required.

Using a keyboard app to type Meetei Script is cumbersome sometimes. First, you have to install it. Second, if you want to use it on another device, you have to install it again. Third, there might be no keyboard app for your platform (for instance, a Linux distro). This is where MSKey comes in.

MSKey allows you to type Meetei Script on any device, everywhere with no installation or configuration. All you need is an internet connection. That's it.

### It's Fast!

The traditional keyboard requires you to long-press a button to type a specific character, which slows down your typing speed. In MSKey, you don't long-press, thereby speeding up your speed and saving time!

### Use Cases

If you own a mobile device with a Meetei Script keyboard (app) installed or configured, then you may use it over this, especially for messaging.

If you are on desktop or other platform with no access to a keyboard, this comes to the rescue. Indeed, this avoids the installation or configuration of an external app. It's accessible everywhere without any prerequisites or setup! If you have no access to a touchscreen and you have a graphing tablet, by all means, use your graphing tablet! It will improve your speed.

### Resizing the Textbox

The textbox may be too small for your use case. If this is so, resize it by dragging the dashed wedge in the bottom-right of the textbox.

### Copy and Paste

Tap on the textbox . The virtual keyboard appears. When you are done, simply press "Copy" button. Now you can paste it anywhere you like!

Be careful not to wrongly press on "Clear" or else you will end up with an empty textbox and you might have to type everything again.
